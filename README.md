My new ViM configuration files.  I love how this environment is working.

I am primarily a PHP, HTML5 and Javascript developer.  I rebuilt my vim configuration files using Vundle instead of pathogen.  I've also stripped out everything not directly related to my daily tasks.

I'm putting them on GitHub for everyone to copy and enjoy.  Most of the bundles from my old configuration are still there—commented out—in repos.vim.
